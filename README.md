# TS-winners

Simple pet project looking for anything interesting in the accounts that are winning the random packs on NBATopShot. I've captured the winner lists from the past few Showcase Challenges and Trivia drawings and found that there seems to be a fair bit of overlap such that roughly half of the winners of the Top Plays Shawcase Challenge were also winners of hte All NBA Showcase Challenge; considering that many tens of thousands of people completed these challenge, that ~1800 accounts managed to win both seems a little off. 

Happy to have anyone else take a look at the code; verify the data, and determine if my figures are off.

The data files contain the URL of the original winners list in line #1
